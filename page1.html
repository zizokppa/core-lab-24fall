    <h1>Project Description</h1>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="reflection">
            In this electronic self-portrait, I used my Spotify data to explore the theme of contrast and contradiction, which I believe are central to my identity. The project features a combination of sound and abstract visuals, centered around my most-listened-to song by Faye Wong. The sound element of the piece includes this track, which serves as an anchor, while the abstract GIFs create a sense of visual chaos and fluidity. The contrast between the structured, melodic song and the unpredictable, abstract movements of the visuals symbolizes the contradictions within me. The abstract nature of the GIFs adds a layer of ambiguity, representing the complexities of my inner world. This mixture of sound and imagery, though seemingly disjointed at times, is deliberate and reflective of the contrast and contradiction that shape my self-perception. The project is intended to express how these opposing forces coexist in harmony, offering a multifaceted view of who I am.        </div>
