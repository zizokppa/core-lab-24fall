                For my electronic self-portrait, I focused on the concept of contrast and contradiction within my Spotify data, as I believe these elements make up a significant part of my identity. Faye Wong is my favorite artist, and her music resonates deeply with my emotional state. According to the data, I’ve listened to Faye Wong’s songs for over 50 hours this year, with her song "Holiday" being my most played track at 120 listens. Her soothing, melancholic style forms the foundation of my listening habits.

However, the contradiction lies in the occasional appearance of techno tracks, which contrasts sharply with the soft tones of Faye Wong. These techno songs often surface during times of heightened energy or emotional tension, reflecting a split in my emotional landscape. This contrast inspired my digital self-portrait.     </div>
